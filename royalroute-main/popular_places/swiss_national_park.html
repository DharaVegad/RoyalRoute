      <h1>Welcome to Swiss National Park</h1>
      <p class="para1">
        The Swiss National Park is located in the Western Rhaetian Alps, in
        eastern Switzerland. It is within the canton of Graubünden, between
        Zernez, S-chanf, Scuol, and the Fuorn Pass in the Engadin valley on the
        border with Italy. It is part of the worldwide UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
      </p>
      <p class="para2">
        It was founded on 1 August 1914, the national holiday of Switzerland. It
        was one of the earliest national parks in Europe. As of 2009, it is the
        only National Park in Switzerland, though there are plans to create
        more. It has an area of 174.2 km² and is the largest protected area
        of the country. In the park, it's not allowed to: leave marked paths,
        light a fire or sleep outside the Chamanna Cluozza; the mountain hut
        located in the park. It is also forbidden to disturb animals or plants,
        or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed, even
        on a leash. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the
        only park in the Alps which has been categorized by the IUCN as a strict
        nature reserve, the highest protection level.
