      <h2>ABOUT SWITZERLAND</h2>
      <p>
        Switzerland is the tourism and diplomatic capital of the world and the
        Swiss have separate and distinct stances in religion, politics and
        culture. This multicultural country has Germany as its northern
        neighbour, Austria and the Liechtenstein as its Eastern neighbour, Italy
        as its Southern neighbour and France as its western neighbour.
        <br /><br />
        Travelling for Switzerland is going across mountains and lakes. Any
        season is beautiful to come to this small country in central
        Europe.Switzerland is one of the most mountainous countries in Europe.
        The Swiss Alps cover 70% of its land area and together with the lakes
        and rivers are the main tourists places.n its mountainous terrain are
        lakes and rivers ideal for water sports. Even some of them, have
        beautiful waterfalls that blend with the colors of the thick vegetation
        that is around.The main economic engine of the Alps is, without doubt,
        the practice of skiing in Switzerland. There are numerous ski slopes
        that are considered the best in the world for its facilities and its
        natural beauty.
